  "description": "useScrollTracker is a custom React hook that tracks the user's scroll progress on a web page or within a specific container. It returns the current scroll percentage, making it easy to implement features like reading progress bars, infinite scrolling, scroll-based animations, and sticky headers. The hook is lightweight, flexible, and suitable for enhancing user experience in React applications. With built-in support for both window and custom container elements, useScrollTracker helps developers seamlessly integrate scroll-based features into their projects.",
